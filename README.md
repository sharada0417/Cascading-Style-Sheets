## Explanation of Key Concepts

### Semantic CSS

Semantic CSS focuses on using descriptive names for HTML elements. It helps improve readability, accessibility, and maintainability by associating styles with the meaning of elements instead of just their appearance.

**Key Points:**
- **Descriptive Naming:** Use names based on the role of the element (e.g., `header`, `footer`, `button`).
- **Clear Structure:** Styles follow the logical structure of the page.
- **Improved Accessibility:** Helps with screen readers and better understanding of content.

### Utility CSS

Utility CSS uses single-purpose classes to style elements directly in HTML. Tailwind CSS is an example of a utility-first CSS framework that allows for rapid styling without writing custom CSS.

**Advantages:**
- **Speed:** Quick styling without writing additional CSS.
- **Consistency:** Ensures uniform design across the application.
- **Small CSS Files:** Reduces the need for large custom stylesheets.
- **Flexibility:** Combines classes to create unique designs without overriding styles.

**When to Use:**
- When you need to style elements quickly.
- For projects with a consistent design system.
- When reducing CSS file size is a priority.

## Technologies Used

- **React**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first CSS framework for rapid UI development.
- **HTML5**: Structure and semantics of web pages.
- **CSS3**: Styling of web pages using modern techniques.
